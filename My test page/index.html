    <h1>Hardanger Embroidery</h1>
    <p>The origins of this beautiful embroidery style are unknown. Traditionally it is worked with white thread on white fabric. In the late 17th century it was popularized in an area of Norway known as Hardanger. The word <strong>Hardangersom</strong> associated that specific district with <strong>hvitsøm</strong> meaning "work in white".</p>
