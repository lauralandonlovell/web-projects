      <a href="images/winnieEars.JPG">Teckels</a> are great watchdogs. No need for a <a href="https://www.bosch-smarthome.com/fr/fr/">smart home</a> when you have a Teckel around! <a href="images/teckelsCommons.jpeg">Teckels</a> will let you know when someone is approaching your door before your doorbell knows.
    </p> 
    <p>
      The excellent hearing and sensitive <a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/dachshund">nose</a> of the Teckel give them the tools they need to bolster your home security system.
    </p> 
    <p>
      Equipped with a sharp bark, Teckels can give their owners a heads up when there is anything out of the norm in their environment.
